# Ask Before Deciding — Mandatory AskUserQuestion Usage

## Rule

**BEFORE presenting the user with any multi-option decision, you MUST invoke `AskUserQuestion`.** Free-text "A or B?" prose, bulleted choice lists ending in "which one?", and prose checkbox alternatives all violate this rule. If you catch yourself drafting one as text, STOP and call `AskUserQuestion` instead.

For the strict superset of cases (yes/no, unresolved items in plans/reports, default values, destructive actions, skill bodies needing decisions), see [`always-ask-on-unresolved.md`](always-ask-on-unresolved.md). When in conflict, that rule wins.

## If AskUserQuestion is deferred

`AskUserQuestion` is auto-deferred in long-context sessions (its NAME appears in the deferred-tools reminder; schema is NOT loaded). Direct call fails with `InputValidationError`. **Required first action:**

```
ToolSearch(query="select:AskUserQuestion", max_results=1)
```

`decision-tools-preload.cjs` emits a `[t1k:decision-tools]` reminder each session. Never use "tool is deferred" to justify prose questions in a skill body — load the schema first. No `settings.json` knob pins specific tools as eager (verified 2026-04-29).

### ⛔ Forbidden phrasings — these are rule violations

If you find yourself drafting any of the following, **STOP** and run `ToolSearch(query="select:AskUserQuestion", max_results=1)` instead:

- "AskUserQuestion isn't available as a deferred tool here. I'll ask in prose."
- "AskUserQuestion is unavailable, falling back to prose questions."
- "Since AskUserQuestion isn't loaded, here are the options: Q1… Q2… Q3…"
- Any prose Q1/Q2/Q3 list, bulleted "Pick one of:" block, or numbered checkbox-alternatives that would otherwise be a structured `AskUserQuestion` call.

Deferral is never a justification for a prose fallback — the schema is one `ToolSearch` call away. After the schema loads, invoke `AskUserQuestion` with batched options as originally intended. This applies to every skill body and every agent; do NOT duplicate this list into individual skill SKILL.md files (the rule is auto-loaded into every session).

## When NOT to use

Plan-approval flows use `ExitPlanMode`, not this tool. Yes/no factual questions and pure-acknowledgment replies stay as prose.
