# Game Feel Foundations

## When This Skill Triggers

- Diagnosing *why* a game feels floaty, twitchy, sluggish, mushy, or autopilot
- Establishing perception-threshold targets (frame budget, input-to-response latency)
- Measuring an existing prototype against the 6-metric framework
- Reverse-engineering the feel of a reference game into measurable parameters
- Auditing a build against the 8 principles of good game feel
- Defining what "feels right" before tuning numbers in a tactical pass
- Picking between *theory* (this skill) and *tactics* (game-feel-juice) when unsure

## Decision Tree

| User intent | Route to |
|---|---|
| "Make it feel better" / general / no diagnosis yet | 6-metric framework + 8 principles checklist (this SKILL.md) |
| "Why is X floaty / twitchy / sluggish / mushy?" | `references/metric-response.md` (ADSR envelope diagnosis) |
| "What numbers should I target?" | `references/definition-and-perception.md` (perception thresholds) |
| "How do I reverse-engineer game X's feel?" | `references/case-study-methodology.md` (12-step checklist) |
| "Audit my build against good-feel principles" | `references/principles-checklist.md` (8 yes/no audit tests) |
| "Polish, particles, screen shake, hit-stop, easing curves" | Defer to `game-feel-juice` (sibling skill, tactical toolbox) |

## The 3-Part Definition (Swink, p.6)

> "Real-time control of virtual objects in a simulated space, with interactions
> emphasized by polish."

A game has feel only when **all three** are present:

1. **Real-time control** — input maps to state every frame, not turn-by-turn
2. **Virtual objects in a simulated space** — the controlled thing exists in a
   spatial frame with consistent physics-or-pseudo-physics rules
3. **Polish** — sensory cues (visual + audio + haptic) emphasize each interaction

Missing any one of the three → not "game feel," it's something else (turn-based
play, abstract simulation, or spreadsheet UI).

## Perception Thresholds (hard numbers)

| Threshold | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Frame rate floor (motion illusion holds) | 10 fps | Swink, p.43–44 |
| Modern smoothness baseline | 30+ fps | Swink, p.43–44 |
| Response feels instant | ≤50 ms | Swink, p.45 |
| Response feels tight | 50–100 ms | Swink, p.45 |
| Response feels sluggish | 100–150 ms | Swink, p.45 |
| Response feels broken | >240 ms | Swink, p.45 |

Below 10 fps the eye loses motion illusion; above 240 ms input-to-response the
player infers the game is broken or networked-laggy. Targets in between are
genre- and verb-dependent.

## The 6-Metric Framework

Swink decomposes "feel" into six measurable axes. Tune any one in isolation and
you affect the whole, but each has a distinct knob set and anti-pattern.

| Metric | Definition | Key Knob | Anti-Pattern | File |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Input** | The player's control surface | sensitivity, dimensions, dead zone | mushy, oversensitive | `references/metric-input.md` |
| **Response** | Input → state mapping (ADSR envelope) | attack / decay / sustain / release | floaty (>100ms attack) | `references/metric-response.md` |
| **Context** | Spatial framing of the controlled object's motion | object spacing, scale, camera framing | hemmed-in, autopilot | `references/metric-context.md` |
| **Polish** | Sensory cues that emphasize each interaction | animation curves, particles, audio decay | over-/under-/muddy-polish | `references/metric-polish.md` |
| **Metaphor** | Inferred physical reality (mass, weight, friction) | mass cues consistency across senses | lightweight giant | `references/metric-metaphor.md` |
| **Rules** | Meaning, agency, and difficulty around the action | difficulty curve, reward clarity | arbitrary, opaque | `references/metric-rules.md` |

**Reading order if you only have 30 minutes:** Response → Polish → Input. These
three account for most "this feels wrong" diagnoses.

## The 8 Principles of Good Game Feel

| # | Principle | Audit lens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Predictable Results | Same input + same state → same outcome |
| 2 | Instantaneous Response | Avatar moves on the input frame |
| 3 | Easy but Deep | Trivial to learn one verb, lifetime to master combinations |
| 4 | Novelty | Each level/system introduces a fresh input-response pairing |
| 5 | Appealing Response | Output is sensorially pleasant on its own |
| 6 | Organic Motion | Curves, not linear ramps; secondary motion |
| 7 | Harmony | All 6 metrics reinforce one feel, not contradict |
| 8 | Ownership | Player owns the wins AND the losses |

Each principle has a yes/no audit test (observable from the shipped build, not
designer introspection).

## 30-Min Reverse-Engineering Methodology

When asked "why does game X feel so good — can we copy that?", apply the
12-step methodology to extract X's feel signature into measurable parameters
you can re-implement.

## Polish-vs-Theory Decision Rule

Both `game-feel-foundations` and `game-feel-juice` cover "feel." They are
complementary, not redundant:

- Asking *why* a hit doesn't feel meaty / *how much* polish is enough →
  **this skill** (Polish is one of the 6 metrics; framework lets you measure it)
- Asking *how* to add the meaty hit (screen-shake values, hit-stop frames,
  particle counts, easing curves) → **`game-feel-juice`** (tactical toolbox)
- Both skills MAY co-fire when the request needs theory + tactics together
  (e.g., "diagnose why my hits feel wrong AND tune the screen shake")

## Cross-References

- `game-feel-juice` — tactical polish toolbox (screen shake, hit-stop, particles, easing curves) — sibling skill in this module
- `game-ux-design` — UI/UX feedback budget vs HUD readability
- engine camera skills (auto-activated via registry) — camera-feel implementation
- engine animation skills (auto-activated via registry) — curve and tween implementation
